# ReaDaWrite
A project for analyzing German sentences, and filtering them for information.

## Setup
First of all, for this project to work, you need to have installed Python 3.

To start the program, you need to compile it.
You can do so, by runnning `PreCompiler.py` (if you are a dev, you need to run it every time after changing a source-file).

This will then create `KI.py`, which is the 'final' program.

Just run it, and enjoy :)
